# Introduction to Security Analyst Fundamentals
This blog is designed to give an insight into the Security Fundamentals course offered by IBM(Coursera) that discusses about various concepts such as Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, Cryptography, Incidence Response and Digital Forensics. In this blog, we shall discuss each of these concepts in brief.

## Penetration Testing

### Introduction to Penetration Testing
- Penetration testing, often abbreviated as pen testing, is a simulated cyber attack against a computer system, network, or web application to assess its security vulnerabilities. 
- This process involves ethical hacking techniques to identify weaknesses that an attacker could exploit. 
- Penetration testing is crucial for organizations to ensure their systems are secure and to comply with regulatory requirements.
### Key Phases of Penetration Testing
1. ***Planning Phase :*** This involves setting the scope and rules of engagement for the test.
2. ***Discovery Phase:*** Identifying potential vulnerabilities using reconnaissance methods.
3. ***Attack Phase:*** Exploiting identified vulnerabilities.
4. ***Verification Phase :*** Confirming the vulnerabilities.
5. ***Reporting Phase :*** Documenting findings and recommendations.
### Tools Used
Common tools include OWASP ZAP and SNYK for scanning code repositories.

## Threat Hunting

### Understanding Threat Hunting
Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity strategy that involves actively searching for threats within a network or system that may have evaded traditional security controls. It requires a deep understanding of network behavior and the ability to analyze anomalies that could indicate malicious activity.

### Key Componenets of Threat Hunting
**1.** ***Threat Intelligence***: 
Utilizing external and internal data to understand potential threats.
**2.** ***Anomaly Detection***:
 Identifying unusual patterns in network traffic.
**3.** ***Tools and Techniques***: 
Leveraging SIEM systems, SOAR tools, and AI/ML for enhanced detection.

### Benefits of Threat Hunting
Enhances security posture by detecting threats early and reducing response time.

### Introduction to Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication by transforming plaintext into unreadable ciphertext. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data.
### Key Concepts
**1.** ***Encryption Algorithms***: 
Symmetric (e.g., AES) and asymmetric (e.g., RSA).
**2.** ***Key Exchange Protocols***: 
Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
**3.** ***Digital Signatures***: 
Ensuring data authenticity and integrity.
### Applications
Secure data transmission, secure communication protocols, and digital signatures.

## Incident Response

### Understanding Incident Response
Incident response is a structured approach to managing and responding to security incidents. It involves a series of steps to minimize the impact of a breach and restore normal operations.
### Key Steps in Incident Response
1. ***Detection and Analysis:*** Identifying and understanding the incident.
2. ***Containment***: Limiting the spread of the incident.
3. ***Eradication***: Removing the root cause.
4. ***Recovery***: Restoring systems and data.
5. ***Post-Incident Activities***: Reviewing and improving processes.
### Tools and Techniques 
Utilizing NIST guidelines and security orchestration tools.

### Introduction to Digital Forensics
Digital forensics involves the collection, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence in legal matters. It plays a crucial role in investigating cybercrimes by analyzing data from computers, networks, and other digital devices.

### Key Steps in Digital Forensics

1. ***Data Acquisition***: Collecting digital evidence.
2. ***Analysis***: Examining data for relevant information.
3. ***Reporting***: Presenting findings in a legal context.

### Applications
Cybercrime investigations, intellectual property theft, and civil disputes.
