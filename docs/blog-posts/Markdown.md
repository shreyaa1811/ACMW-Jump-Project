# Introduction to Markdown 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It allows users to add formatting elements to plain text documents using simple syntax, making it easy to read and write. Markdown is widely used for web publishing, documentation and note-taking due to its simplicity and versatality.

## üîëKey Features of Markdown
### 1. Portability and Platform Independence
Markdown files can be opened on any device and operating system, making it a great choice for collaborative work or cross-platform compatability.
### 2. Easy Syntax
Markdown uses familiar punctuation and characters to format text. For example, headings are denoted by # symbols, while asterisks (*) or underscores (_) are used for emphasis.
### 3. Conversion to HTML
Markdown text can be easily converted to HTML, allowing it to be viewed in web browsers or integrated with style sheets for printing.

## üìùBasic Markdown Syntax
#### 1. Headings 
Use **#** symbols to define headings. The number of # symbols determines the heading level (e.g., # Heading 1, ## Heading 2)
#### 2. Emphasis
 Use single asterisks (*) for *italics* and double asterisks (**) for **bold text**
 #### 3. Lists
 Create unordered lists with dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+)

**Sample:**
 ```
 - Fruits
   + Apple
   + Banana 
   + Grapes
     - Black grapes
     - Green grapes ......
```

 **Output :**
 
 - Fruits
   + Apple
   + Banana 
   + Grapes
     - Black grapes
     - Green grapes ......

#### 4. Links
 Format links by surrounding the link text with square brackets and the URL with parentheses 

#### 5. Tables
Use pipes (|) to create tables with headers and rows.

**Sample :**
```
| Name  | Age | City     |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Alice | 25  | New York |
| Bob   | 30  | London   |
| Eve   | 22  | Paris    |
```

**Output :**
| Name  | Age | City     |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Alice | 25  | New York |
| Bob   | 30  | London   |
| Eve   | 22  | Paris    |
 
 **Sample :**
 ```
[Link Text](https://example.com)
 ```
**Output :**
 [Link Text](https://example.com)
