# Welcome to My ACMW-Jump Project

## About This Project

This documentation site is part of the ACM-W Junior Mentorship Program (JuMP), a 3-month initiative designed to help participants learn from experienced mentors, collaborate on exciting projects, and grow in their technical journey.

<!-- TODO: MENTEE - Add a brief description of the specific project you're working on -->
The project that we are working on is an advanced security monitoring system that uses AI(specifically LLM's) to generate realistic security data and detect potential threats. 

## My Role

<!-- TODO: MENTEE - Describe your role in the project and your responsibilities -->
As a mentee in the ACMW-Jump program, I have been assigned the role of the Security and Database Engineer. My focus will be on traditional security analysis and database handling. 

My responsibilities include :
- Creating rule-based detection systems using security patterns.
- Working with multiple data sources(MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Examples :
   - Alert when 5+ failed logins occur in 1 minute.
   - Detect suspicious access at odd hours.
   - Identify multiple logins from different locations.
